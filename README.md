This is a Blackjack game that I've made to practice object oriented programming and error handling with Python.
The player is allowed to choose any amount of chips to begin and any amount of chips to wager per round, as long as it does not exceed the player's starting chip.

Per normal game rules, if exceeding a total of 21, that party busts. Ace can act as 1 or 11 depending on current amount in hand.
Actions available include "Hit" and "Stand". When Hit, player draws a card. If Stand was chosen, player is satisfied with their current hand and dealer will begin their actions.Both party's hands are shown throughout the round.

Finally, the player is given the option to continue when a winner has been declared and will be required to choose their next wager. Of course, this assumes the player still has chips remaining :). If the option to play again is no, the game ends.

Thoughts: The game ended up containing more lines than I thought. I feel I could've shortened some code here and there. Also, I was so absorbed in this project, I forgot to document. I definitely should've documented.
